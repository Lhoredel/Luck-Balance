# Luck-Balance
This code solves the Luck Balance problem by maximizing Lena's luck through strategic contest losses. It separates important contests, sorts them in descending order of luck value, and calculates optimal losses within the allowed limit k. The algorithm adds luck from unimportant contests and the k most important contests lost, while subtracting luck from excess important contests that must be won.
